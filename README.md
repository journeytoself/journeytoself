Welcome to my world, through this blog I wish to be honest with myself about my journey. I wish to step out of my cocoon to be able to fly and create a life for myself where I travel on a road back to myself or a journey that I take to myself.

I was really excited to seek help from one of my colleagues to create this blog and during our conversation he mentioned to me that anything posted on the internet is never confidential and that was it for me. I couldn't get down to putting my thoughts and feelings here. I take the courage today to pen down a few lines about how the past few days have been for me.

I often read about self care, self love and thought it to be so selfish. Now, when I reflect on it, I think my belief stemmed from my upbringing. I saw mum,aunts, grand mother always sacrificing for everyone in their lives, Oh, that should have made them the happiest in the family but alas, they were always so sad, they always wanted the entire family to validate their sacrifice, their suffering. I too haven't been any different. I sacrificed every bit of me in terms of my time, my sleep, my choices, my food.... for everyone around me, hoping to be loved, to be cared for but soon realised i was the most miserable in the family. There wasn't anyone looking after me and then this realisation that was it because I wasn't looking after myself? It was time to introspect, time to take that road to self, time to take constructive steps to love myself.
